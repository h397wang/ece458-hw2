/******************************************************************************
 * This file contains the server side PHP code that students need to modify 
 * to implement the password safe application.  Another PHP file, server.php,
 * should not need to be modified and handles initialization of some variables,
 * resource arbitration, and outputs the reponse.  The last PHP file is api.php
 * which should also not be modified by students and which provides an API
 * for resource functions to communicate with clients.
 * 
 * Student code in this file should only interact with the outside world via
 * the parameters to the functions.  These parameters are the same for each 
 * function.  The Request and Reponse classes can be found in api.php.
 * For more information on PDO database connections, see the documentation at
 * https://www.php.net/manual/en/book.pdo.php or other websites.
 *
 * The parameters to each function are:
 *   -- $request A Request object, passed by reference (see api.php)
 *   -- $response A Response object, passed by reference (see api.php)
 *   -- $db A PDO database connection, passed by reference
 *
 * The functions must also return the same values.  They are:
 *   -- true on success, false on failure
 *
 * Students should understand how to use the Request and Response objects, so
 * please spend some time looking at the code in api.php.  Apart from those
 * classes, the only other API function that students should use is the
 * log_to_console function, which MUST be used for server-side logging.
 *
 * The functions that need to be implemented all handle a specific type of
 * request from the client.  These map to the resources the client JavaScript
 * will call when the user performs certain actions.
 * The functions are:
 *    - preflight -- This is a special function in that it is called both 
 *                   as a separate "preflight" resource and it is also called
 *                   before every other resource to perform any preflight 
 *                   checks and insert any preflight response.  It is 
 *                   especially important that preflight returns true if the
 *                   request succeeds and false if something is wrong.
 *                   See server.php to see how preflight is called.
 *    - signup -- This resource should create a new account for the user
 *                if there are no problems with the request.
 *    - identify -- This resource identifies a user and returns any 
 *                  information that the client would need to log in.  You 
 *                  should be especially careful not to leak any information 
 *                  through this resource.
 *    - login -- This resource checks user credentials and, if they are valid,
 *               creates a new session.
 *    - sites -- This resource should return a list of sites that are saved
 *               for a logged in user.  This result is used to populate the 
 *               dropdown select elements in the user interface.
 *    - save -- This resource saves a new (or replaces an existing) entry in 
 *              the password safe for a logged in user.
 *    - load -- This resource loads an existing entry from the password safe
 *              for a logged in user.
 *    - logout -- This resource should destroy the existing user session.
 *
 * It is VERY important that resources set appropriate HTTP response codes!
 * If a resource returns a 5xx code (which is the default and also what PHP 
 * will set if there is an error executing the script) then I will assume  
 * there is a bug in the program during grading.  Similarly, if a resource
 * returns a 2xx code when it should fail, or a 4xx code when it should 
 * succeed, then I will assume it has done the wrong thing.
 *
 * You should not worry about the database getting full of old entries, so
 * don't feel the need to delete expired or invalid entries at any point.
 *
 * The database connection is to the sqlite3 database "passwordsafe.db".
 * The commands to create this database (and therefore its schema) can
 * be found in "initdb.sql".  You should familiarize yourself with this
 * schema.  Not every table or field must be used, but there are many 
 * helpful hints contained therein.
 * The database can be accessed to run queries on it with the command:
 *    sqlite3 passwordsafe.db
 * It is also easy to run SQL scripts on it by sending them to STDIN.
 *    sqlite3 passwordsafe.db < myscript.sql
 * This database can be recreated (to clean it up) by running:
 *    sqlite3 passwordsafe.db < dropdb.sql
 *    sqlite3 passwordsafe.db < initdb.sql
 *
 * This is outlined in more detail in api.php, but the Response object
 * has a few methods you will need to use:
 *    - set_http_code -- sets the HTTP response code (an integer)
 *    - success       -- sets a success status message
 *    - failure       -- sets a failure status message
 *    - set_data      -- returns arbitrary data to the client (in json)
 *    - set_cookie    -- sets an HTTP-only cookie on the client that
 *                       will automatically be returned with every 
 *                       subsequent request.
 *    - delete_cookie -- tells the client to delete a cookie.
 *    - set_token     -- passes a token (via data, not headers) to the
 *                       client that will automatically be returned with 
 *                       every subsequent request.
 *
 * A few things you will need to know to succeed:
 * ---------------------------------------------------
 * To get the current date and time in a format the database expects:
 *      $now = new DateTime();
 *      $now->format(DateTimeInterface::ISO8601);
 *
 * To get a date and time 15 minutes in the future (for the database):
 *      $now = new DateTime();
 *      $interval = new DateInterval("PT15M");
 *      $now->add($interval)->format(DateTimeInterface::ISO8601);
 *
 * Notice that, like JavaScript, PHP is loosely typed.  A common paradigm in
 * PHP is for a function to return some data on success or false on failure.
 * Care should be taken with these functions to test for failure using === 
 * (as in, if($result !== false ) {...}) because not using === or !== may 
 * result in unexpected ceorcion of a valid response (0) to false.
 *
